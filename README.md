FooBar
========

The program prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Foo" instead of the number and for 
the multiples of five print "Bar". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FooBar".

```
> sbt run 
Output: 1 2 Foo 4 Bar Foo 7 8 Foo Bar 11 Foo 13 14 FooBar 16 17 Foo ……
